 INSIGHTS AND RECCOMENDATION

1. Customer Insights
The top 5 customers contribute disproportionately to total sales and profit — consider loyalty programs or exclusive offers for this group.


2. Regional Performance
Western and Central regions show strong profits and sales — but some regions may have high sales but lower profits due to shipping or discount costs.



3. Top Products & Categories
Top-selling sub-categories like "Phones" and "Chairs" dominate sales volume.

However, not all top sellers are the most profitable. Categories like "Binders" sell well but have lower margins

4. Sales & Profit Trends
Year-over-Year (YoY) sales growth shows consistent increases, but the rate of growth may be slowing — indicating a need to either expand the customer base or improve product offerings..

5. Discount Optimization:
Implement tighter discount controls (e.g. 25% max) in high-loss states to restore profit

6. Prioritize profitable states:
Invest in marketing and expansion in strong states like California, New York, and Washington.
